This React App was created with Redux. It is a search engine which uses the SWAPI (Star Wars API) to display characters that have (in their data) properties that match the search string. You can search by gender (male/femal), by height/weight (a number), or by name.   

## Deployment 

This application can be found [here.](https://starwarssearch-d4d4b.web.app/)

## User Experience

After the characters from the API have loaded onto the page enter a search value such as "Luke" or "Female" or "77" and the characters that have these strings at the beginning of any of their properties will load onto the screen. Those that don't will be filtered out.
